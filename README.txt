Features added:
- Fish collides with top and bottom of screen, so can't go off screen in those directions
- pressing B switches between basic controls and momentum based controls, 
	where holding a direction builds momentum in that direction, and momentum will gradually
	dissipate if no buttons are held
- Turtles now have 3 different possible movement paths which are randomly chosen: 
	They can either go straight left, go left and slightly up, or go left and slightly down
